# Practice Python

This is my work on some of the problems at [practicepython.org](practicepython.org). They are beginner exercises, but I thought they were a nice way to show my ability to write clean, well-documented code.

## Usage example

To run an example exercise:

```sh
python pythonpractice.py
```
You'll then be asked which example exercise you'd like to run. You can input any number between 1 and 36, where numbers correspond to those exercises listed on the [practicepython.org](practicepython.org) website. Some exercises require one or more of the ``.txt`` files included here. Be sure to pull the files you need!

I've also made some the exercises that are games into their own programs so you can play them on their own, without needing to know which exercise they correspond to. You can play:

- Rock, Paper, Scissors! (Exercise 8, ``rps.py``),
- Cows and Bulls (Exercise 18, ``cows_bulls.py``),
- Tic Tac Toe (Exercises 24, 26, 27, and 29, ``tic_tac_toe.py``), or
- Hangman (Exercises 30, 31, and 32, ``hangman.py`` )
