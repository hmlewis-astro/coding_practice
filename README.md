# Practice Python

This is my work on some of the problems at [practicepython.org](practicepython.org). They're beginner exercises, but I thought they were a nice way to show my ability to write clean, well-documented code.

## Usage example

To run the each component of the pipeline:

```sh
python pythonpractice_low_high.py num
```
where `num` can be replaced by any number in the range `low` to `high`, and each number corresponds to an exercise on the Practice Python website.
