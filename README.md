# Practice Python

This is my work on some of the problems at [practicepython.org](practicepython.org). I thought they were a nice way to show my ability to write clean, well-documented code

## Usage example

To run the each component of the pipeline:

```sh
python pythonpractice_1_10.py --num 1
```
where --num
