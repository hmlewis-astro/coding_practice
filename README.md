# Practice Python

This is my work on some of the problems at [practicepython.org](practicepython.org). They are beginner exercises, but I thought they were a nice way to show my ability to write clean, well-documented code.

## Usage example

To run an example exercise:

```sh
python pythonpractice.py
```
You'll then be asked which example exercise you'd like to run. You can input any number between 1 and 36 (currently, I only have workng examples for 1 through 29, as of August 2020).

You can also play a game of Tic Tac Toe (Exercise 29) using

```sh
python tic_tac_toe.py
```
